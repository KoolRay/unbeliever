name: unbeliever
version: 0.10.0.0
synopsis: Opinionated Haskell Interoperability
description: |
  A library to help build command-line programs, both tools and
  longer-running daemons.

  A description of this package, a list of features, and some background
  to its design is contained in the
  <https://github.com/oprdyn/unbeliever/blob/master/README.markdown README>
  on GitHub.

  An ancillary aim of this library is to facilitate interoperability. A
  single batteries-included package would make this easier, but the resulting
  dependency footprint would be considerable. The code is thus spread across
  several packages:

  * __core-text__
  * __core-data__
  * __core-program__
  
  Useful starting points in the documentation are "Core.Program.Execute"
  and "Core.Text.Rope".
